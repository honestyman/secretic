## How to run Secretic locally?

I believe you already have Docker installed. If not, just do it on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).


Build the `app` image with the following command:

```shell
docker compose build --no-cache
```

>This command might take a few minutes to complete.

When the build is finished, you can run the environment in background mode with:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Weâ€™ll now run `composer install` to install the application dependencies:

```shell
docker compose exec app composer install
```

Copy the environment settings:

```shell
docker compose exec app cp .env.local .env
```

Migrate DB & seed fake data with the `artisan` Laravel command-line tool:

```shell
docker compose exec app ./artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

And open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your favorite browser. Happy using Secretic! 


## Can I trust a instance of Secretic not hosted by me?

No. Anyone could modify the functionality of Secretic to expose your secret key to the server. We recommend using a instance you host or trust.

## How to run terminal inside container?

Just run:

```bash
docker exec -ti secretic-app bash
```
