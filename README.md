## Requesting features

Open a [new issue](https://github.com/secretica/secretic/issues/new) to request a feature (or if you find a bug).


## Run the app with Docker

Before running the Secretic locally:

- Instead of repeatedly typing `vendor/bin/sail` to execute Sail commands, you may wish to configure a Bash alias ```alias sail='[ -f sail ] && bash sail || bash vendor/bin/sail'```
- Copy the environment settings ```cp .env.example .env```
- And replace `DB_HOST` to `mysql` in `.env` (for local development).

After that just run the command:

- ```sail up -d``` to run the Secretic ([What if I don't have PHP and Composer on my computer?](https://github.com/secretica/secretic/issues/570))
- ```sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed``` to migrate DB & seed fake data

And open http://127.0.0.1 in your favorite browser. Happy using Secretic! 


## Can I trust a instance of Secretic not hosted by me?

No. Anyone could modify the functionality of Secretic to expose your secret key to the server. We recommend using a instance you host or trust.
